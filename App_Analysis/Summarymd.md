# App Analysis

*Following MD file is intended to organize the steps taken in order to do full data analysis on the datasets.*

### Part 1

Data Cleaning

Data Cleaning is the first step to any data analysis. `(Data Collection is not taken into consideration, but should be before Data Cleaning)` in order to carry out Data Cleaning, going through all the datasets is required, as some rows of the dataset could be corrupted. 

> ### Corrupted Datasets
>
> There are many factors for determining if the dataset is corrupted.
>
> - Does the following Dataset have certain Columns that are missing `values`
> - Does certain columns include different `datatypes` 
> - Does the `Dataset` have unsupported `charsets` _(i.e. Chinese, Korean ... )_ 
> - Does it contain duplicate data? Duplicated data can change the result of the model reducing the accuracy of the result.

Clearing the data of corrupted dataset is important as it can heavily influence the result of the prediction. As such, it is of utmost importance to take into consideration the criterion of clearing the data. 

Below are some examples of clearing data of corrupted data.

**Duplicate Data**

First going through the dataset to check for duplicates is important

```python
# Clearing Data of Duplicate Data
def dup_dat(dataset):
    uniq_dat = {}
    dup_list = []
    for app in dataset:
        # Assuming the title index is at [1] of the dataset
        if app in uniq_dat:
            dup_list.append(app)
        else:
            uniq_dat[app[1]] = app
    # The Following list contains duplicate list
    print(len(dup_list))
```

Once it has been confirmed that there are duplicate data in the dataset, coming up with a criterion for processing the duplicate data is important. In our case, the `Rating` and `Number of Rates` is important, as it is plays an important role in determining the popularity of the app itself. Thus, I have determined that either keeping the data with the highest `Review Count` would result in a more accurate result of the model.

As such, I thought it viable that creating a refined dataset of the model through obtaining max of `Review Count` of each data

``` python
def max_list(dataset):
    uniq_dat_max = {}
    for app in dataset:
        # Assuming the `Review Count` to be at index [4]
        name = app[1]
        reviews = app[4]
        if name in uniq_dat_max and uniq_dat_max[name] < reviews:
            uniq_dat_max[name] = reviews
        elif name not in uniq_dat_max:
            uniq_dat_max[name] = reviews
    return uniq_dat_max

def refined_list(dataset):
    uniq_max = max_list(dataset)
    refined_dat = []
    for app in dataset:
        name = app[1]
        reviews = app[4]
        if uniq_max[name] == reviews:
            refined_dat.append(app)
	return refined_dat
            
```

By looping through each iteration by using `dict`, it is possible to get the unique data from the `dataset`.

### Part 2

Data Analysis

Once the data has been cleared of any corrupted data, going through the data and finding out which columns will be used for the analysis is a necessary procedure, but in order to do so, the objective of the project should be taken into consideration before filtering the necessary columns. 

The goal of the project should be taken into account, 

> ### Determining the objective
>
> Objective of the following project is to analyze the data in order come up with a strategy to maximize the profit of making an app `(Following Project excluded any paid apps and non-english apps from the dataset)`.

As stated above, the object of the following project is to find a strategy to maximize the profit of the app that the team will be making. As such, the important columns for the project includes `Reviews`, `Number of Reviews`, `Cost of the App`, `Category`.
