# Data Aggregation

Extracting meaningful insights from datasets requires cleaning â€” lots of it. So, it's critical to know how to manipulate data quickly and efficiently.

In this section, we'll learn to aggregate data with `pandas`. Here are a couple of takeaways:

- Different techniques for aggregating data
- Building intuition around the groupby operation

To get the most out of this section, it is important to be familiar with `panda`, `matplotlib` library and be able to filter through Data Frame. 

In this section, **World Happiness Report** will be used for Data Aggregation, which assigns each country with a **happiness score** based on poll results.

- How can aggregating the data give us more insight into happiness scores?
- How did world happiness change from 2015 to 2017?
- Which factors contribute the most to the happiness score?
