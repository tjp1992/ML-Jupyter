# Storytelling Data Visualization

The previous bar graph was easy for viewers to comprehend, however, the graph did not have a story that told the viewers. In the following section, we'll be using `Matplotlib`'s object-oriented interface to compose a line plot that shows a story like **below**.

The following graph shows the progress in which the **Covid-19** was spread in United States. The graph is composed of four line graph that shows 4 different periods in the graph to emphasize the process of the data.

**Grid Chart**

First step would be to make the frame of the `grid chart` that would encompass four line graphs. As we have done before with the `grid chart` we can create the grid using [`plt.subplots()` function](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.subplots.html). We also have to adjust the `figzie` of the grid chart to change the proportion of the graph.

```python
fig, (ax1,ax2,ax3,ax4) = plt.subplots(nrows=4, ncols=1, figsize=(6,8))
```

We can create a transparent line graph for each grid using `for` loop on a list of all the `Axes` and applying `alpha` parameter to the `Axes.plot()` function.

```python
axes = [ax1, ax2, ax3, ax4]
for ax in axes:
    ax.plot(death_toll['Month'], death_toll['New_deaths'],
            color='#af0b1e', alpha=0.1)

    # Assume the rest of the code is written
```

Now that all the grids are filled with the same line graph that has transparency(`alpha`) of `0.1` , we can add another line above the one created to emphasize the duration of the line graph on each grid by using `Axes.plot()` and applying `color` and `linewidth` parameter along with specific dataset we want for the period by using index slicing.

```python
# Assume the rest of the code is written 
ax1.plot(death_toll['Month'][:3], death_toll['New_deaths'][:3],
         color='#af0b1e', linewidth=2.5)
ax2.plot(death_toll['Month'][2:6], death_toll['New_deaths'][2:6],
         color='#af0b1e', linewidth=2.5)
```

The structure has a nice ration of data-ink ratio, but it does not have texts for the audience to comprehend the graphs. we can use [`Axes.text()` method](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.axes.Axes.text.html) to add texts that will support the audience to better understand the graph.

```python
# Assume the rest of the code is written
ax1.text(0.5, -80, '0', alpha=0.5)
ax1.text(3.5, 2000, '1,844', alpha=0.5)
ax1.text(11.5, 2400, '2,247', alpha=0.5)
```

This shows the values of the `peaks` but it is enough for the audience to fully grasp the contents of the data. We can further inform the audience of the data in each chart by adding another `text()` on the `Axes` object.

```python
# Assume the rest of the code is written
ax1.text(1.1, -300, 'Jan - Mar', color='#af0b1e',
         weight='bold', rotation=3)
```
