# Personal Machine Learning Projects

This repository is Intended for personal studying purposes. It entails the different projects that are present in [Kaggle](http://kaggle.com) and tutorial courses from [DataQuest](http://dataquest.io). 

I am just a junior programmer who's about to embark on a new journey to understanding machine learning. I do realize the solutions I came up with might not be the most efficient nor literate, but I hope those who are new to ML just as I am, will join me in this quest to better understand concepts of ML.

I have the file categorized into [StudyNotes](https://github.com/tjp1992/ML-Jupyter/tree/main/StudyNotes), [ML_Study_PJT](https://github.com/tjp1992/ML-Jupyter/tree/main/ML_Study_PJT), [Projects](https://github.com/tjp1992/ML-Jupyter/tree/main/Projects/). The first two directories **StudyNotes** and **ML_Study_PJT** includes notes for using different libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib` , `numpy` and etc. These two files should be a recap of `Data Cleaning`, `Data Visualization`. **Projects** contains personal projects that I have worked on personally.

I would recommend going through the **StudyNotes** and then to **Basics** just to get a better grip on each library as it is essential in the process of Machine Learning.
