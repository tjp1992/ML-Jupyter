# Personal Machine Learning Projects

This repository is Intended for personal studying purposes. It entails the different projects that are present in [Kaggle](http://kaggle.com) and tutorial courses from [DataQuest](http://dataquest.io). 

I am just a junior programmer who's about to embark on a new journey to understanding machine learning. I do realize the solutions I came up with might not be the most efficient nor literate, but I hope those who are new to ML just as I am, will join me in this quest to better understand concepts of ML.

I have the file categorized into [Basics](https://github.com/tjp1992/ML-Jupyter/tree/main/Basics), [Visualization](https://github.com/tjp1992/ML-Jupyter/tree/main/Visualization/WestBound_Traffic), [Intermediate](https://github.com/tjp1992/ML-Jupyter/tree/main/Intermediate/Stock_Analysis) and More to come. Reason behind such categorization is that in the **Basics** I do not use `panda` or `matplotlib` to better understand the functionality of each library and how it can expediate the **ML** experience. 

I would recommend going through the **Basics** and then to **Visualization** just to get a better grip on each library as it is essential in the process of Machine Learning.
