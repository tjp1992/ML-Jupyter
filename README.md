# Personal Machine Learning Projects

This repository is Intended for personal studying purposes. It entails the different projects that are present in [Kaggle](http://kaggle.com) and tutorial courses from [DataQuest](http://dataquest.io). 

I am just a junior programmer who's about to embark on a new journey to understanding machine learning. I do realize the solutions I came up with might not be the most efficient nor literate, but I hope those who are new to ML just as I am, will join me in this quest to better understand concepts of ML.
