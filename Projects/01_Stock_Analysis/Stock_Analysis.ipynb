The goal of this project is not to make a complicated model that will predict the closing price of certain stock, but to make a classification model to predict whether the stock will increase or decrease the next day. \n",
        "\n",
        "Thus, we want to maximize our `True Positives` - days when algorithm predicts that the price will go up, and it actually goes up. Therefore, we'll be using precision as our error metric for the algorithm, which is `True Positives / (False Positives + True Positives)`, basically percentage of `True Positives` out of all our predictions. This will ensure minimization of loss with `False Positives`(Days when the stock has been purchased, but the price actually goes down).\n",
